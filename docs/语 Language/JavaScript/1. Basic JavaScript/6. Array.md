# Array
With [[1. JavaScript|JavaScript]] `array` variables, we can store several pieces of data in one place.

We start an array declaration with an opening square bracket, end it with a closing square bracket, and put a comma between each entry, like this 

```js
const sandwitch = ["peanut butter", "jelly", "bread"];
const myArr = ["Hello", 1];
```
---

# Nest one Array within Another
We can also nest [[6. Array|arrays]] within other arrays, like this:

```js
const teams = [["bulls", 23], ["White Sox", 45]];
```
---

# Access Array Data with index
We can access the data inside [[6. Array|arrays]] using indexes.

Array index are written in the sam bracket notation that strings use, except that instead of specifying a character, they specifying an entry in the array. Like strings, arrays use *zero-based* indexing, so the first element in an array has an index of ```0```, like this:

```js
const arr = [10, 20, 30];
const data = array[0];
```
---

# Modify Array Data with Index
Unlink strings, the entires of array are *mutable* and can be changed freely, even if the array was declared with ```const```. Like this:

```js
const ourArray = [50, 40, 30];
oirArray[0] = 15;
```
---

# Access Multi-Dimensional Arrays With Indexes
One way to think of a *multi-dimensional* array, is as an _array of arrays_. When you use brackets to access your array, the first set of brackets refers to the entries in the outer-most (the first level) array, and each additional pair of brackets refers to the next level of entries inside. Like this:

```js
const arr = [
	[1,2,3],
	[4,5,6],
	[7,8,9],
	[[10, 11, 12], 13, 14]
];

arr[3];
arr[3][0];
arr[3][0][1];
```
`arr[3]` is `[[10, 11, 12], 13, 14]`, `arr[3][0]` is `[10, 11, 12]`, and `arr[3][0][1]` is `11`.

---

# Append data to Array
## [[Manipulate]] Array With push()
An easy way to **append** data to the end of an array is via the ```push()``` function.

```.push()``` takes one or more *parameters* and "pushes" them onto the end of the array. Example:

```js
const arr1 = [1, 2, 3];
arr1.push(4);

const arr2 = ["a", "b", "c"];
arr2.push(["d", "e"]);
```
```arr1``` now have value ```[1, 2, 3, 4]```.
```arr2``` now have value ```["a", "b", "c", ["d", "e"]]```.

---

## [[Manipulate]] Arrays With unshift()
```.unshift()``` adds the element at the beginning of the array. `.unshift()` works exactly like `.push()`, but instead of adding the element at the end of the array.

```js
const arr = [1, 4, 5];
arr.shift();
arr.unshift(2);
```
```arr``` now have value ```[2, 4, 5]```;

---
# Remove data from Array
## [[Manipulate]] Array With pop()
```.pop()``` is used to pop a value off the end of an array. We can store this popped off value by assigning it to variable. In other words, ```.pop()``` removes the last element from an array and returns that element.

Any type of entry can be popped off of an array - numbers, strings, even nested arrays.

```js
const arr = [1, 4, 6];
const myVar = arr.pop();
```
```arr``` now have value ```[1, 4]```.
```myVar``` now have value ```6```.

---

## [[Manipulate]] Array With shift()
`.shift()` works just like `.pop()`, except it removes the **first** element instead of the last.

```js
const arr = [1, 4, 6];
const myVar = arr.shift();
```
```arr``` now have value ```[4, 6]```.
```myVar``` now have value ```1```.

---

# Merge arrays
The **`concat()`** method is used to merge two or more arrays. This method does not change the existing arrays, but instead returns a new array.

``` js
const array1 = ['a', 'b', 'c'];
const array2 = ['d', 'e', 'f'];
const array3 = array1.concat(array2);

console.log(array3);
// expected output: Array ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f"]
```

----

# Splice
## Remove Items
`splice()` allows us to do just that: **remove any number of consecutive elements from anywhere in an array**. `splice()` accept 3 parameters:

- The first two parameter of `splice()` are integers which represent index, or positions, of the array.

``` js
let arr = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e'];

let newArr = arr.splice(2,2);
```
Here we remove 2 elements, beginning with the third element (index 2). `array` would have the value `['a', 'b', 'e']`, and ```newArr``` has the value `['c', 'd']`.

## Add Items
We can use the third parameter, comprised of one or more element(s), to add to the array. This can be incredibly useful for quickly switching out an element, or a set of elements, for another.

```js
const number = [10, 11, 12, 12, 15];
const startIndex = 3;
const amountToDelete = 1;

numbers.splice(startIndex, amounToDelete, 13, 14);
console.log(number);
```
The second occurrence of `12` is removed, and we add `13` and `14` at the same index. The `numbers` array would now be `[10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]`.

Here, we begin with an array of numbers. Then, we pass the following to `splice()`: The index at which to begin deleting elements (3), the number of elements to be deleted (1), and the remaining arguments (13, 14) will be inserted starting at that same index. Note that there can be any number of elements (separated by commas) following `amountToDelete`, each of which gets inserted.

---

# Copy Array Items
## With the Slice 
Rather than modifying an array, `slice()` copies or *extracts* a given number of elements to a new array, leaving the array it is called upon untouched. `clice()` takes only 2 parameter -  the first is the index at which to begin extraction, and the second is the index at which to stop extraction (extraction will occur up to, but not including the element at this index). Consider this:

```js
let weatherConditions = ['rain', 'snow', 'sleet', 'hail', 'clear'];

let todaysWeather = weatherConditions.slice(1, 3);
```
`todaysWeather` would have the value `['snow', 'sleet']`, while `weatherConditions` would still have `['rain', 'snow', 'sleet', 'hail', 'clear']`.

## With the [[5. Spread Operator|Spread Operator]]
While `slice()` allows us to be selective about what elements of an array to copy, among several other useful tasks, ES6's new [[5. Spread Operator|spread operator]] allows us to easily copy _all_ of an array's elements, in order, with a simple and highly readable syntax. The spread syntax simply looks like this: `...`

In [[practice]], we can use the [[5. Spread Operator|spread operator]] to copy an array like so:

```js
let thisArray = [true, true, undefined, false, null];
let thatArray = [...thisArray];
```

---

# Combine Arrays
## With the [[5. Spread Operator|Spread Operator]]
Another huge advantage of the [[5. Spread Operator|spread operator]] is the ability to combine arrays, or to insert all the elements of one array into another, at any index. With more traditional syntaxes, we can concatenate arrays, but this only allows us to combine arrays at the end of one, and at the start of another. Spread syntax makes the following operation extremely simple:

```js
let thisArray = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'];
let thatArray = ['1', '2', '3', ...thisArray, '4'];
```
`thatArray` would have the value `['1','2','3','4',a','b','c','d']`

Using spread syntax, we have just achieved an operation that would have been more complex and more verbose had we used traditional methods.

# Presence of an Element
## With the indexOf()
Since arrays can be changed, or _mutated_, at any time, there's no guarantee about where a particular piece of data will be on a given array, or if that element even still exists. Luckily, [[1. JavaScript|JavaScript]] provides us with another built-in method, `indexOf()`, that allows us to quickly and easily check for the presence of an element on an array. `indexOf()` takes an element as a parameter, and when called, it returns the position, or index, of that element, or `-1` if the element does not exist on the array.

```js
let fruits = ['apples', 'pears', 'oranges', 'peaches', 'pears'];

fruits.indexOf('dates');
fruits.indexOf('oranges');
fruits.indexOf('pears');
```
`indexOf('dates')` returns `-1`, `indexOf('oranges')` returns `2`, and `indexOf('pears')` returns `1` (the first index at which each element exists).


---

# Iterate
 JavaScript offers several built in methods that each iterate over arrays in slightly different ways to achieve different results (such as `every()`, `forEach()`, `map()`, etc.)

Array functions, which are methods on the array object prototype.

---
# .forEach
```Array.prototype.forEach()```

```js
const array1 = ['a', 'b', 'c'];

array1.forEach(element => console.log(element));

// expected output: "a"
// expected output: "b"
// expected output: "c"
```

---

# .map()
 `Array.prototype.map()`, or more simply `map`. The `map` method iterates over each item in an array and returns a new array containing the results of calling the callback function on each element. It does this without mutating the original array.
 
```js
const users = [
  { name: 'John', age: 34 },
  { name: 'Amy', age: 20 },
  { name: 'camperCat', age: 10 }
];

const names = users.map(user => user.name);
console.log(names);
```
The console would display the value `[ 'John', 'Amy', 'camperCat' ]`.

 ## Implement
```js
Array.prototype.myMap = function(callback) {
	const newArray = [];
	this.forEach(x => newArray.push(callback(x)));
	return newArray;
};
	
const new_s = s.myMap(function(item) {
	return item * 2;
});
```

---

# .filter()
`Array.prototype.filter()`, or simply `filter()`. only the elements for which that function returns `true`. In other words, it filters the array, based on the function passed to it. Like `map`, it does this without needing to modify the original array. 

The callback function accepts three arguments. The first argument is the current element being processed. The second is the index of that element and the third is the array upon which the `filter` method was called.

```js
const words = ['spray', 'limit', 'elite', 'exuberant', 'destruction', 'present'];

const result = words.filter(word => word.length > 6);

console.log(result);
// expected output: Array ["exuberant", "destruction", "present"]
```

```js
const filteredList = watchList.filter(x => x.imdbRating > 8).map(x => {
	return {title: x.Title, rating: x.imdbRating};
});

// with destructuring assignement
const filteredList = watchList.filter(x => x.imdbRating > 8).map(({Title: title, imdbRating: rating}) => ({title, rating}));
```
## Implement
```js
Array.prototype.myFilter = function(callback) {
	const newArray = [];
	this.forEach(x => callback(x) ? newArray.push(x) : false);
	return newArray;
};
```

---

# .reduce()
```js
const array1 = [1, 2, 3, 4];
const reducer = (previousValue, currentValue) => previousValue + currentValue;

// 1 + 2 + 3 + 4
console.log(array1.reduce(reducer));
// expected output: 10

// 5 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4
console.log(array1.reduce(reducer, 5));
// expected output: 15
```

 ---

 # .reverse()
```js
const array1 = ['one', 'two', 'three'];
console.log('array1:', array1);
// expected output: "array1:" Array ["one", "two", "three"]

const reversed = array1.reverse();
console.log('reversed:', reversed);
// expected output: "reversed:" Array ["three", "two", "one"]

// Careful: reverse is destructive -- it changes the original array.
console.log('array1:', array1);
// expected output: "array1:" Array ["three", "two", "one"]

```

---
 
# .join()
```js
const elements = ['Fire', 'Air', 'Water'];

console.log(elements.join());
// expected output: "Fire,Air,Water"

console.log(elements.join(''));
// expected output: "FireAirWater"

console.log(elements.join('-'));
// expected output: "Fire-Air-Water"
```

---

# .indexOf()
```js
const beasts = ['ant', 'bison', 'camel', 'duck', 'bison'];

console.log(beasts.indexOf('bison'));
// expected output: 1

// start from index 2
console.log(beasts.indexOf('bison', 2));
// expected output: 4

console.log(beasts.indexOf('giraffe'));
// expected output: -1
```
---

# .find()
```js
const array1 = [5, 12, 8, 130, 44];

const found = array1.find(element => element > 10);

console.log(found);
// expected output: 12
```
