# Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE)
A common pattern in JavaScript to execute a function as soon as it is declared:

```js
(function() {
	console.log("Chirp, chirp!");
})();
```
This is an anonymous function expression that executes right away, and output `Chirp, chirp!` immediately.

**Note** that the function has no name and is not stored in a variable. The two parentheses() at the end of the function expression cause it to be immediately execute or invoked. This pattern is known as an immediately invoked function expression or IIFE.

## Use an IIFE to Create a Module
An Immediately Invoked Function expression (IIFE) us often to group related functionality into a single object or `module`. For exampleï¼Œ

```js
function glideMixin(obj) {
  obj.glide = function() {
    console.log("Gliding on the water");
  };
}
function flyMixin(obj) {
  obj.fly = function() {
    console.log("Flying, wooosh!");
  };
}
```

We can group these mixins into a module as follows:

```js
let motionModule = (function (){
	return {
		glideMixin: function(obj){
			obj.glide = function(){
			    console.log("Gliding on the water");
			}
		}
		flyMixin: function(obj){
			obj.fly = function(){
				console.log("Flying, wooosh!")
			}
		}
	}
})();
```
Now, we have an IIFE that return an object `motionModule`. This returned object contains all of the mixin behaviors as properties of the object. The advantage of the module patterns is that all of the motion behaviros can be packaged into a single object that can then be used by other parts of our code. Here is an example using it:

```js
motionModule.glideMixin(duck);
duck.glide();
```
