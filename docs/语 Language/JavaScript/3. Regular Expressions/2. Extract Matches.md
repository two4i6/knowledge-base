# Extract Matches
We can also extract the actual matches we found with the `.match()` method.

To use the `.match()` method, apply the method on a string and pass in the regex inside the parentheses.

```js
"Hello World!".match(/Hello/);
let ourString = "Regualr expressions";
let ourRegex = /expressions/;
ourStr.match(ourRegex);
```
Here the first `match` would return `["Hello"]` and the second would return `["expressions"]`.

Note that the `.match` syntax is the "opposite" of the `.test` method you have been using thus far:

```js
'string'.match(/regex/);
/regex/.test('string');
```
