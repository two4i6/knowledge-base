# Access Props Using this.props
With ES6 class components, we will see this is a little different. The ES6 class component uses a slightly different convention to access props.

Anytime we refer to a class component within itself, we use the `this` keyword. To access props chitin a class component, we preface the code that we use to access it with `this`. For example, if an ES6 class component has a prop called `data`, we write `{this.props.data}` in JSX.
