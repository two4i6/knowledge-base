# Define an HTML Class in JSX
We may be wondering how JSX differs from HTML.

So far, it may seem that HTML and JSX are exactly the same. 

In fact, the naming convention for all HTML attributes and event references in JSX become camelCase. 

One key difference in JSX is that we can no longer use the word `class` to define HTML classes. This is because `class` is a reserved word in JavaScript. Instead, JSX uses `className`.

For example, a click event in JSX is `onClick`, instead of `onclikc`. Likewise, `onchange` becomes `onChange`. While this is a subtle difference, it is an important one to keep in mind moving forward.

```jsx
const JSX = (
	<div className="myDiv"> 
		<h1> Add a class to this div</h1>
	</div>
);
```

Here we we apply a class of `myDiv` to the `div` in the JSX code.
