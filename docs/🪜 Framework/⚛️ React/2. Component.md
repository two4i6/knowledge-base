# Component
Components are the core of React. Everything in React is a component.

There are two ways to create a React component. 

- The first way is to use a JavaScript Function. Defining a component in this way creates a *[[2.1 Stateless Functional Component|stateless functional component]]*. 

- The second way is with the ES6 [[10. Constructor Function|class]] syntax, by create a new class and let it extends `React.Commponent`.

Because a JSX component represents HTML, we could put several components together to create a more complex HTML page. This is one of the key advantages of the component architecture React provides. It allows we to compose our UI from many separate, isolated components. This makes it easier to build and maintain complex user interfaces.

When you work with React, it is important to start thinking about your user interface in terms of components like the App example in the last challenge. You break down your UI into its basic building blocks, and those pieces become the components. This helps to separate the code responsible for the UI from the code responsible for handling your application logic. It can greatly simplify the development and maintenance of complex projects.
