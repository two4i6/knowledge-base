# State
One of the most important topics in React is `state`. State consists of any data our application needs to know about, that can change over time. We want our apps to respond to state changes and present an updated UI when necessary. React offers a nice solution for the state management of modern web applications.

`state` is one of the most powerful features of components in React. It allows you to track important data in your app and render a UI in response to changes in this data. If your data changes, your UI will change. React uses what is called a virtual DOM, to keep track of changes behind the scenes. When state data updates, it triggers a re-render of the components using that data - including child components that received the data as a prop. React updates the actual DOM, but only where necessary. This means we don't have to worry about changing the DOM. You simply declare what the UI should look like.
