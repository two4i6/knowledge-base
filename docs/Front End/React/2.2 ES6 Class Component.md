# Use ES6 Class syntax to Create React Component
For example, let a class extends `React.Component` :

```jsx
class Kitten extends React.Component {
	constructor(props) {
		super(props);
	}

	render() {
		return (
			<h1> Hello World </h1>
		);
	}
}
```

This creates an ES6 class `kitten` which extends the `React.Component` class. So the `Kitten` class now has access to many useful React features, such as local state and lifecycle hooks.

Also notice the `Kitten` class has a `constructor` defined within it calls `super()`. It use `super()` to call the constructor of the parent class, in this case `React.Component`.

The constructor is a special method used during the initialization of objects that are created with the `class` keyword. It is best practice to call a component's `constructor` with `super`, and pass `props` to both. This makes sure the component is initialized properly. It is standard for this code to be included.
