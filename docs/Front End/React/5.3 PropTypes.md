# Use PropTypes to Define the Props You Expect
React provides useful type-checking features to verify that components receive props of the correct type. For example, our application makes an API call to retrieve data that we expect to be in an array, which is then passed to a component as a prop. We can set `propTypes` on our component to require the data to be of type `array`. This will throw a useful warning when the data is of any other type.

We can define a `propTypes` property for a component in the same way we defined `defaultProps`. Doing this will check that props of a given key are present with a given type. Here's an example to require the type `function` for a prop called `handleClick`.

```jsx
MyComponent.propTypes = { handleClick: PropTypes.func.isRequired };
```

In the example above, the `PropTypes.func` part check that `handleClick` is a function. Adding `isRequired` tells React that `handleClick` is required property for that component. We will see a warning if that prop isn't provided. Also notice that `func` represents `function`. 

Among the seven JavaScript primitive types, `function` and `boolean` (written as `bool`) are the only two that use unusual spelling. In addition to the primitive types.  In addition to the primitive types, there are other types available. For example, you can check that a prop is a React element. Please refer to the [documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/typechecking-with-proptypes.html#proptypes)for all of the options.
