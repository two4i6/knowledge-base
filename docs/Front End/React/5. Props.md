# Props
**Props** is a very common feature in React. In React, we can pass props, or properties, to child components. 

Say we have an `App` component which renders a child component called `Welcome` which is a stateless functional component. We can pass `Welcome` a `user` property by writing:

```jsx
<App>
	<Welcome user='Mark' />
</App>
```

We can **custom HTML attributes** created by us and supported by React to passed to the component. In this case, the created property `user` is passed to the component `Welcome`. Since `Welcome` is a [[2.1 Stateless Functional Component|stateless functional component]], it has access to this value like so:

```jsx
const Welcome = (props) => <h1>Hello, {props.user}!</h1>;
```

It is standard to call this values `props` and when dealing with stateless functional components, we basically consider it as an argument to a function which returns JSX. We can access the value of the argument in the function body. 

```jsx
const CurrentDate = (props) => {
	return (
		<div>
			<p>The current date is: {props.date}</p>
		</div>
	);
};


class Calendar extends React.Component {
	constructor(props) {	
		super(props);
	}
	
	render() {
		return (
			<div>
				<h3>What date is it?</h3>
				<CurrentDate date={Date()}/>
			</div>
		);
	}
};
```
