# ComponentDidMount()
Most web developers, at some point, need to call an API endpoint to retrieve data. If we're working with React, it's important to know where to perform this action.

The best perceptive with React is to place API calls or any calls to our sever in the lifecycle method `componentDidMount()`. 

`componentDidMount()` method is called after a component is mounted to the DOM. Any calls to `setState()` here will trigger a re-rendering of our component. When we call an API in this method, and set our state with the data that the API returns, it will automatically trigger an update once we receive the data.

```jsx
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
	constructor(props) {
		super(props);
		this.state = {
		activeUsers: null
		};
	}
	
	componentDidMount() {
		setTimeout(() => {
			this.setState({
			activeUsers: 1273
			});
		}, 2500);
	}
	
	render() {
		return (
			<div>
			<h1>Active Users: {this.state.activeUsers}</h1>
			</div>
		);
	}
}
```

# Event Listeners
The `componentDidMount()` method is also the best place to attach any event listeners we need to add for specific functionality. 

React provides a synthetic event system which wraps the native event system present in browsers. This means that the synthetic event system behaves exactly the same regardless of the user's browser - even if the native events may behave differently between different browsers.

We're already been using some of these synthetic event handlers such as `onClick()`. React's synthetic event system is great use for most interactions we'll manage on DOM elements. However, if we want to attach an event handler to the document or window objects, we have to do this directly.

```jsx
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
	constructor(props) {
	super(props);
	this.state = {
		message: ''
	};
	this.handleEnter = this.handleEnter.bind(this);
	this.handleKeyPress = this.handleKeyPress.bind(this);
}

	componentDidMount() {
		document.addEventListener("keydown", this.handleKeyPress);
	}
	
	componentWillUnmount() {
		document.removeEventListener("keydown", this.handleKeyPress);
	}
	
	handleEnter() {
		this.setState((state) => ({
			message: state.message + 'You pressed the enter key! '
		}));
	}
	
	handleKeyPress(event) {
		if (event.keyCode === 13) {
			this.handleEnter();
		}
	}
	
	render() {
		return (
			<div>
				<h1>{this.state.message}</h1>
			</div>	
		);
	}
};
```
