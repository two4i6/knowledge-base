# Component with Composition
We can compose multiple React components together. we could create an `App` parent component which renders each of these components as *children*. 

To render a component as a child in a React component, we include the component name written as a custom HTML tag in the JSX. For example, in the `render` method we could write:

```jsx
class ParentComponent extends React.Component {
	constructor(props) {
		super(props);
	}
	render() {
		return (
			<App>
				<Navbar />
				<Dashboard />
				<Footer />
			</App>
		);
	}
}
```

Here we build an `app` component and have created three components: a `Navbar`, `Dashboard`, and `Footer`.

When React [[encounter|encounters]] a custom HTML tag that references another component (a component name wrapped in `< />`), it renders the markup for that component in the location of the tag. This should illustrate the parent/child relationship between the `App` component and the `NavBar`, `Dashboard`, and `Footer`.
