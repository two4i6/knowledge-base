# Render HTML Elements to the DOM
As we know JSX is a convenient tool to write readable HTML within JavaScript. With React, we can render this JSX directly to the HTML DOM using React's rendering API known as `ReactDOM`.

`ReactDOM` offers a simple method to render React elements to the DOM which looks like this: 

```jsx
ReactDOM.render(COMPONENT_TO_RENDER, TARGET_NODE),
```

Where the first argument is the React element or component that we want to render, and the second argument is the DOM node that we want to render the component to.

As we would expect, `ReactDOM.render()` must be called after the JSX element declarations, just like how we must declare variables before using them.

For example, to render this component to the page by `ReactDOM.render()` method, we can pass defined JSX elements directly in as the first argument and use `document.getElementByID()` to select the DOM node to render them to.

```jsx
const JSX = (
	<div>
		<h1>Hello World</h1>
		<p>Lets render this to the DOM</p>
	</div>
);

ReactDOM.render(JSX, document.getElementByID('node'));
```

There is a `div` with `id='node'` available for us to use.
