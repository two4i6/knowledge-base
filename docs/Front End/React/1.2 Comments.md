# Add Comments in JSX
JSX is a syntax that gets compiled into valid JavaScript. 

Sometimes, for readability, we might need to add comments to our code. Like most programming languages, JSX has it own way to do this.

To put commit inside JSX, we use the syntax `{/* */}` to wrap around the comment text.

```jsx
const JSX = (
	<div>
		{*/ This is a block of JSX /*}
		<p> Hello World </p>
	</div>
);
```
