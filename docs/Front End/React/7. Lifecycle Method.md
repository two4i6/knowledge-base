# Lifecycle Method
React components have serval special methods that provide opportunities to perform actions at specific points in the lifecycle of a component. There are called lifecycle methods, or lifecycle hooks.

Lifecycle methods allow us to catch components at certain points in time. This can be before they are rendered, before they update, before they receive props, before they unmount, and so on.

Here is a list of some of the main lifecycle methods:

`componentWillMount()`: called before the `render()` when a component is being mount to the DOM.log something to the console within `componentWill()`- you may want to have your browser console open to see the output.

`componentDidMount()`
`shouldComponentUpdate()` 
`componentDidUpdate()`
`componentWillUnmount()`
