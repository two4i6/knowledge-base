# Create a Complex JSX Element
The last example was a simple JSX, but JSX can represent more complex HTML as Well.

One important thing to know about nested JSX is that is must return a single element.

This one parent element would wrap all of the other levels of nested elements.

For instance, several JSX elements written as siblings with no parent wrapper element will no transpile. Here's an example:

**Valid JSX**:

```jsx
<div>
  <p>Paragraph One</p>
  <p>Paragraph Two</p>
  <p>Paragraph Three</p>
</div>
```

**Invalid JSX**:

```jsx
<p>Paragraph One</p>
<p>Paragraph Two</p>
<p>Paragraph Three</p>
```

For example, define a new constant `JSX` that renders a `div` which contains an `h1`, a `p`, and an unordered list that contains three `li` items:

```jsx
const JSX = (
	<div>
		<h1>Hello World</h1>
		<p>Paragraph</p>
		<ul>
			<li>1</li>
			<li>2</li>
			<li>3</li>
		</ul>
	</div>);
```

Note: This example object worth noting that under the hood the challenges are calling 
`ReactDOM.render(JSX, document.getElementById('root'))`. This function call is what places your JSX into React's own lightweight representation of the DOM. React then uses snapshots of its own DOM to optimize updating only specific parts of the actual DOM.
