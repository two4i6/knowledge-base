# JSX
React uses a syntax extension of JavaScript called JSX that allow us to write HTML directly within JavaScript. This have several benefits. It lets us see the full programmatic power of JavaScript within HTML, and helps to keep our code readable.

For the most part, JSX is similar to the HTML, however there are a few key differences.

For instance, because JSX is a syntactic extension of JavaScript, we can actually write JavaScript directly within JSX. To do this, we simply include the code we want to be treated as JavaScript within curly braces: `{ 'this is treated as JavaScript code' }`. 

However, because JSX is not valid JavaScript, JSX code must be complied into JavaScript. The transpiler Babel is a popular tool for this process. 

For example, create a simple JSX element:

```jsx
const JSX = <h1> Hello World</h1>;
```

Note: This example object worth noting that under the hood the challenges are calling 
`ReactDOM.render(JSX, document.getElementById('root'))`. This function call is what places your JSX into React's own lightweight representation of the DOM. React then uses snapshots of its own DOM to optimize updating only specific parts of the actual DOM.
