# Stateless Functional Component
Think of a stateless component as one that can receive data and render it, but does not manage or track changes to that data.

To create a stateless functional component with a function, we simple write a JavaScript function that returns either JSX or `null`. One important thing to note is that React requires our function name to begin with a capital letter. Here's an example of a stateless functional component that assigns an HTML class in JSX:

```jsx
const DemoComponent = function() {
	return (
		<div className='customClass' /> 
	);
};
```

After begin transpiled, the `<div>` will have a HTML class of `customClass`.
