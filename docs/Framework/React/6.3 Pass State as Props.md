# Pass State as Props to Child Components
When passed props to child JSX elements, we may be wondering where those props come from. A common pattern is to have a stateful component containing the `state` important to our app, that then renders child components. We want these components to have access to some pieces of that `state`, which are passed in as props.

For example, maybe we have an `App` component that renders a `Navbar`, among other components. In our `App`, we have `state` that contains a lot of user information, but the `Navrbar` only needs access to the user's username so it can display it. We pass that piece of `state` to the `Navbar` component as a prop.

This pattern illustrates some important paradigms in React. The first is *unidirectional data flow*. State flows in on direction down the tree of our application's components, from the stateful parent component to child components. The child components only receive the state data they need. The second is that complex stateful apps can be broken down into just a few, or maybe a single, stateful component. The rest of our components simply receive state from the parent as props, and render a UI from that state. It begin to create a separation where state management is handled in one part of code and UI rendering in another. This principle of separating state logic from UI logic in one of React's key principles. When it's used correctly, it makes the design of complex, stateful applications much easier to manage.

```jsx
class MyApp extends React.Component {
	constructor(props) {
		super(props);
		this.state = {
		name: 'CamperBot'
		}
	}
	render() {
		return (
			<div>
				<Navbar name={this.state.name} />
			</div>		
		);
			
	}
	
};

class Navbar extends React.Component {
	constructor(props) {
		super(props);
	}
	render() {
		return (
		<div>
			<h1>Hello, my name is: {this.props.name} </h1>
		</div>
		);
	}
};
```

# Pass a Callback as Props
```jsx
class MyApp extends React.Component {
	constructor(props) {
		super(props);
		this.state = {
			inputValue: ''
		}
		this.handleChange = this.handleChange.bind(this);
	}
	
	handleChange(event) {
		this.setState({
			inputValue: event.target.value
		});
	}
	
	render() {
		return (
		<div>
		<GetInput input={this.state.inputValue} handleChange={this.handleChange} />
		<RenderInput input={this.state.inputValue}/>
		</div>
		);
	}
};

  

class GetInput extends React.Component {
	constructor(props) {
		super(props);
	}
	
	render() {
		return (
			<div>
				<h3>Get Input:</h3>
				<input value={this.props.input} onChange={this.props.handleChange}/>
			</div>
		);	
	}
};

  

class RenderInput extends React.Component {
	constructor(props) {
		super(props);
	}
	
	render() {
		return (		
			<div>
				<h3>Input Render:</h3>	
				<p>{this.props.input}</p>
			</div>
		);
	}
};
