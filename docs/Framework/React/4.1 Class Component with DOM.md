# Render a Class Component to the DOM
None of the React code we write will render to the DOM without making a call to the [[4. ReactDOM|ReactDOM]] API.

React components are passed into `ReactDOM.render()` a little differently than JSX elements. For JSX elements, we pass in the name of the element that we want to render.

For React components, we need to use the same syntax as if we were rendering a nested component. For example `ReactDOM.render(<ComponentToRender />, TARGET_NODE)`. We use this syntax for both [[2.2 ES6 Class Component|ES6 Class Components]] and [[2.1 Stateless Functional Component|functional components]].

```jsx
class TypesOfFood extends React.Component {
	constructor(props) {
		super(props);
	}
	render() {
		return (
		<div>
			<h1>Types of Food:</h1>
			<Fruits />
			<Vegetables />
		</div>	
		);
	}
};

ReactDOM.render(<TypesOfFood />, document.getElementById('challenge-node'));
```
