# Self-Closing JSX Tags
We've seem how JSX differs from HTML in a key way with the use of `className` vs. `class` for defining HTML classes.

Another important way in which JSX differs form HTML is in the idea of the self-closing tag.

There are special instances in HTML called "self-closing tags", that tags don't required both and opening and closing tag before another tag can start. For example the line-break tag can be written as `<br>` or `</br>`.

In JSX, the rules are a little different. Any element can be written with a self-closing tag, and every element must be closed. For example, the line-break tag must be written as `<br />` in order to be valid JSX that can be transpiled. 

A `<div>` can be written as `<div />` or `<div> </div>`. The difference is that in the first syntax version there is no way to include anything in the `<div />`. 

For example:

```jsx
const JSX = (
	<div>
		<h2>Welcome to React!</h2> <br />
		<p>Be sure to close all tags!</p>
		<hr />
	</div>
);
```
