# Dart Data Type
Dart is statically typed (but with support for type inference)
- Statically type means we know the type at compile time.
Dart also has a dynamic type (specified with *dynamic*)
- Dynamic means we determine the type at runtime.
Type inference means we can allow the compiler to determine the type for us (without having to type in).

## Implicit Types
Inferred at compile time, Use the **var** keyword.
- Type checking happens at run-time.
- Use *dynamic* keyword.
- Use of *dynamic* is not generally required nor recommended.
```dart
var value = 18;
var str = 'test';
```

-   Prefer Initializing variables with var as much as you can
-   When the type is not easy to guess, initialize it explicitly to increase readability    
-   Use Object or dynamic only if it is really needed (almost never)
