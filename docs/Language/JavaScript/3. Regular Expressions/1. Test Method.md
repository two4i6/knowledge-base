Regular expressions are used in programming languages to match parts of strings. You create patterns to help you do that matching.

If we want to find the word `the` in the [[5. String|string]] `The dog chased the cat`, we could use the following regular expression: `/the/`. Notice that quote marks are not required within the regular expression.

# Test method
[[1. JavaScript|JavaScript]] has multiple ways to use regexes. One way to test a regex is using the `.test()` method. The `.test()` method takes the regex, applies it to a [[5. String|string]] (which is placed inside the parentheses), and returns `true` or `false` if your pattern finds something or not.

```js
let testStr = "HelloWorld";
let testRegex = /Hello/;
testRegex.test(testStr);
```
The `test` method here returns `true`.

# Match Literal [[5. String|String]]
Here's another example searching for a literal match of the [[5. String|string]] `Kevin`:

```js
let testStr = "Hello, my name is Kevin.";
let testRegex = /Kevin/;
testRegex.test(testStr);
```
This `test` call will return `true`.

Any other forms of `Kevin` will not match. For example, the regex `/Kevin/` will not match `kevin` or `KEVIN`.

```js
let wrongRegex = /kevin/;
wrongRegex.test(testStr);
```

This `test` call will return `false`.
