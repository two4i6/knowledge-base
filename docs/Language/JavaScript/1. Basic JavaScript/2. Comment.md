# Comment 
Comment are lines of code that [[1. JavaScript|JavaScript]] will [[intentionally]] ignore. Comment are a great way to leave notes to ourself and to other people who will later need to figure out what that code does.

There are two way to write comments in [[1. JavaScript|JavaScript]], This is an in-line comment:

``` js
// This is an in-line commnet.
```

We can also make a multi-line comment beginning with ```/*``` and ending with ```*/```. This is a multi-line comment:

``` javaScript
/* This is a multi-line
	comment. */
```
