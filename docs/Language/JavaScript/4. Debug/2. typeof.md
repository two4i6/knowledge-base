# Use typeof to Check the Type of a Variable
We can use `typeof` to check the data structure, or type, of a variable. This is useful in debugging when working with multiple data types. If we think we're adding two numbers, but one is actually a [[5. String|string]], the results can be unexpected. Type errors can lurk in calculations or function calls. Be careful especially when you're accessing and working with external data in the form of a [[1. JavaScript|JavaScript]] Object Notation (JSON) object.

Here are some examples using `typeof`:

```js
console.log(typeof "");
console.log(typeof 0);
console.log(typeof []);
console.log(typeof {});
```

In order, the [[1. console|console]] will display the strings `string`, `number`, `object`, and `object`.

[[1. JavaScript|JavaScript]] recognizes six primitive ([[immutable]]) data types: `Boolean`, `Null`, `Undefined`, `Number`, `String`, and `Symbol` (new with ES6) and one type for mutable items: `Object`. Note that in [[1. JavaScript|JavaScript]], [[6. Array|arrays]] are technically a type of object.
