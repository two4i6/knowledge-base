# Compare Scopes of var and let keywords
When we declare a variable with the ```var``` keyword, it is declared globally, or locally if declared inside a function.

The ```let``` keyword behaves similarly, but with some extra features. When we declare a variable with the ```let``` keyword inside a block, statement, or expression, its scope is limited to that block, statement, or expression.

For example:

```js
var arr = [];
for(var i = 0; i < 3; i++){
	arr.push(i);
}
console.log(arr);
console.log(i);
```
Here the console will display the values `[0, 1, 2]` and `3`.

With the `var` keyword, `i` is declared globally. So when `i++` is executed, it updates the global variable. This code is similar to the following:

```js
var numArray = [];
var i;
for (i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
  numArray.push(i);
}
console.log(numArray);
console.log(i);
```

Here the console will display the values `[0, 1, 2]` and `3`.

This behavior will cause problems if we were to create a function and store it for later use inside a `for` loop that uses the `i` variable. This is because the stored function will always refer to the value of the updated global `i` value.

```js
var printNumTwo;
for (var i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
  if (i === 2) {
    printNumTwo = function() {
      return i;
    };
  }
}
console.log(printNumTwo());
```

Here the console will display the value `3`.

As you can see, `printNumTwo()` prints 3 and not 2. This is because the value assigned to `i` was updated and the `printNumTwo()` returns the global `i` and not the value `i` had when the function was created in the for loop. The `let` keyword does not follow this behavior:

```js
let printNumTwol
for(let i = 0; i < 3; i++){
	if(i === 2){
		printNumTwo = function() {
			return 1;
		}
	}
}
console.log(printNumeTwo());
console.log(i);
```
Here the console will display the value `2`, and an error that `i is not defined`.

`i` is not defined because it was not declared in the global scope. It is only declared within the `for` loop statement. `printNumTwo()` returned the correct value because three different `i` variables with unique values (0, 1, and 2) were created by the `let` keyword within the loop statement.
