# [[Prevent]] Objet Mutation

`const` declaration alone doesn't really protect our data from mutation. To ensure our data 
doesn't change, [[1. JavaScript|JavaScript]] provides a function `Object.freeze` to [[prevent]] data mutation.

Any attempt at changing the object will be rejected, with an error thrown if the script is running in strict mode.

```js
let obj = {
	name: "hello"
	review: "world"
};

Object.freeze(obj);
obj.review = "bad";
obj.newProp = "Test";
console.log(obj); 
```
The `obj.review` and `obj.newProp` assignments will result in errors, because our editor runs in strict mode by default, and the console will display the value `{ name: "hello", review: "world" }`.
