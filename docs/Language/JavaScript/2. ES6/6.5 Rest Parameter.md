# Reassign Array Elements with the Rest Parameter

In some situations involving array destructuring, we might want to collect the rest of the elements into a separate array.

The result is similar to `Array.prototype.slice()`, as shown below:

```js
const [a, b, ...arr] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7];
console.log(a, b);
console.log(arr);
```
The console would display the value `1, 2` and `[3, 4, 5, 6]`.

Variables `a` and `b` take the first and second values from the array. After that, because of the rest parameter's presence, `arr` gets the rest of the values in the form of an array. The rest element only works correctly as the last variable in the list. As in, you cannot use the rest parameter to catch a subarray that leaves out the last element of the original array.

# Pass an object as a Function's Parameters
In some cases, you can destructure the object in a function argument itself.

Consider the code below:

```js
const profileUpdate = (profileData) => {
  const { name, age, nationality, location } = profileData;

}
```

This effectively destructures the object sent into the function. This can also be done in-place:

```js
const profileUpdate = ({ name, age, nationality, location }) => {};
```

Or

```js
const stats = {
	max: 56.78,
	standard_deviation: 4.34,
	median: 34.54,
	mode: 23.87,
	min: -0.75,
	average: 35.85
};

const half = ({max, min}) => (stats.max + stats.min) / 2.0;
```
